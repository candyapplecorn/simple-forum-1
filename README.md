## Planning
* Tamzin: Search algorithm 

### Search
Tamzin created a search algorithm that queries a content list against the searched phrase For each element in content list, check for the phrase. Also, confirm there is an input (by checking the input length is greater than zero). If this condition is true, return the elements in the list that include the searched phrase.
